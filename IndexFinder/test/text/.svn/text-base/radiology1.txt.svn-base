BRAIN MRI:  **DATE[Jun 20 99] AT 1505

Comparison with the prior MR dated **DATE[Nov 6 98].

HISTORY:  EVALUATE FOR NEW OR ACTIVE LESIONS.

TECHNIQUE:  Sagittal short TR, axial long TR, gradient and FLAIR
pulsing sequences were obtained through the brain.  After the
intravenous administration of 13 cc of Omniscan contrast, axial and
coronal short TR pulsing sequences were obtained.

The posterior fossa remains unremarkable in appearance.  The long T2
and FLAIR pulsing sequences demonstrate small punctate foci of
increased signal relative to adjacent brain with the anterior aspect
of the anterior limb of the internal capsule on the right, at the
level of the frontal horn.  This focus is slightly less prominent than
was previously noted and does not demonstrate enhancement.  A 1 mm
focus is demonstrated in the subcortical white matter of the left
insula.  This finding was not demonstrated on the prior exam and does
not demonstrate enhancement currently.  A third and most prominent
focus measuring approximately 3 mm in diameter is present in the left
frontal centrum semiovale and is unchanged in appearance.  It does not
demonstrate enhancement.  A 2 mm subtle focus is also noted in the
right occipital lobe (series 4, image 15) which is less prominent than
previously noted and does not enhance.  No other new lesions are
identified.  There is no evidence of abnormal enhancement.  The
vertebral basilar and bilateral cavernous carotid arteries and
proximal anterior middle cerebral arteries appear unremarkable.

A punctate focus of enhancement is present along the inferior left
putamen which appears to be vascular in origin and may represent a
prominent perforator or tiny venous angioma.

IMPRESSION:

THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF ABNORMAL ENHANCEMENT TO SUGGEST ACTIVE
LESIONS.  OTHER THAN A NEW 1 MM TINY FOCUS IN THE LEFT INSULAR
SUBCORTICAL WHITE MATTER, NO NEW FOCI.  FURTHERMORE, THE PREVIOUSLY
NOTED THREE LESIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE ARE DECREASED IN SIGNAL RELATIVE
TO THE PRIOR EXAM AND APPEAR LESS PROMINENT.

ALL IMAGES ARE AVAILABLE ELECTRONICALLY IN THE RADIOLOGY DEPARTMENT.
A PRINTED SUMMARY SHEET OF IMAGES IS AVAILABLE IN THE FILM FOLDER.
